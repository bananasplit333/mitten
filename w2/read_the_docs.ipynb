      "In Python, type casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. This can be done using built-in functions that correspond to the data types you want to convert to. Here are some common type casting methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Converting to Integer**: You can convert a string or float to an integer using `int()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   num_str = \"123\"\n",
      "   num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Converting to Float**: You can convert a string or integer to a float using `float()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   num_int = 123\n",
      "   num_float = float(num_int)  # Converts integer to float\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Converting to String**: You can convert an integer or float to a string using `str()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   num_float = 123.45\n",
      "   num_str = str(num_float)  # Converts float to string\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Converting to List**: You can convert other iterable types (like tuples or strings) to a list using `list()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   tuple_data = (1, 2, 3)\n",
      "   list_data = list(tuple_data)  # Converts tuple to list\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Converting to Tuple**: You can convert a list or other iterable to a tuple using `tuple()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   list_data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "   tuple_data = tuple(list_data)  # Converts list to tuple\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Converting to Dictionary**: If you have a list of tuples (or another iterable of key-value pairs), you can convert it to a dictionary using `dict()`.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   list_of_tuples = [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]\n",
      "   dict_data = dict(list_of_tuples)  # Converts list of tuples to dictionary\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that when converting types, you need to ensure that the values you are converting are compatible with the target type; for example, converting a non-numeric string to an integer will raise an error.\n"
